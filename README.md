# **EDSA - Sendy Logistics Challenge**
 *by EXPLORE Data Science Academy*
---

## Introduction

Logistics in Sub-Saharan Africa increases the cost of manufactured goods by up to 320%; while in Europe, it only accounts for up to 90% of the manufacturing cost.  Economies are better when logistics is efficient and affordable. Sendy, in partnership with insight2impact facility, is hosting a Zindi challenge to predict the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination.

git push --set-upstream origin Task_Name 
```

5. If task is complete and you wish to merge the work to the **Dev** branch.
create a pull request for review using the web-based github.
